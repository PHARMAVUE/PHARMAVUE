        <h1>Smoking and Sleep Apnea: Study on CPAP Therapy</h1>
    </section>

    <section class="study-description">
        <h2>Study Overview</h2>
        <p>Sleep apnea is a serious condition that causes interrupted breathing during sleep. When combined with smoking, the severity of sleep apnea can increase, leading to a range of health complications. This study focuses on understanding how smoking influences the effectiveness of CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) therapy and aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a new CPAP machine in improving patient outcomes.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="study-details">
        <h2>Study Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Assess the impact of smoking on sleep apnea severity in participants.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the effectiveness of a new CPAP machine designed for individuals with smoking-related respiratory issues.</li>
            <li>Monitor improvements in sleep quality and health outcomes for participants using the new CPAP machine.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="why-smoking-affects-cpap">
        <h2>Why Smoking Affects CPAP Therapy</h2>
        <p>Research shows that smoking can significantly impact the success of CPAP therapy for sleep apnea. Nicotine and other chemicals found in cigarettes can irritate the respiratory system, exacerbate inflammation, and increase airway resistance, making it harder for CPAP therapy to deliver effective results.</p>
        <p>Some of the ways smoking affects CPAP therapy include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Increased airway inflammation:</strong> Smoking causes inflammation in the respiratory tract, which can worsen sleep apnea symptoms and reduce CPAP effectiveness.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced lung function:</strong> Smoking can reduce lung capacity, making it harder to breathe comfortably during sleep.</li>
            <li><strong>Impaired blood circulation:</strong> Smoking impairs circulation, which can affect the oxygenation of tissues during sleep and hinder the success of CPAP therapy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By testing a new CPAP machine specifically designed for smokers, we aim to provide better support and improved treatment outcomes for those with both conditions.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="cpap-machine-testing">
        <h2>Testing the New CPAP Machine</h2>
        <p>The new CPAP machine is designed with enhanced pressure settings and advanced filtration to address the unique needs of smokers with sleep apnea. Key features of this new machine include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adjustable pressure settings:</strong> Tailored to accommodate variations in airway resistance caused by smoking.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved filtration system:</strong> Designed to filter out irritants and pollutants that may exacerbate respiratory symptoms in smokers.</li>
            <li><strong>Compact and quiet design:</strong> Provides more comfort and convenience for users while reducing the noise associated with traditional CPAP machines.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Participants in this study will receive access to this cutting-edge technology and provide valuable feedback on its effectiveness in managing sleep apnea symptoms, especially in those with a history of smoking.</p>
